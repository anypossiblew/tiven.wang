title: Version Control with Git
excerpt: "Powerful Tools and Techniques for Collaborative Software Development. Although some familiarity with revision control systems will be good background material, a reader who is not familiar with any other system will still be able to learn enough about basic Git operations to be productive in a short while. More advanced readers should be able to gain insight into some of Gitâ€™s internal design and thus master some of its more powerful techniques."
