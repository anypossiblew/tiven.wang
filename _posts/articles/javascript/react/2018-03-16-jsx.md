JSX is an XML-like syntax extension to ECMAScript without any defined semantics. It's NOT intended to be implemented by engines or browsers. **It's NOT a proposal to incorporate JSX into the ECMAScript spec itself.** It's intended to be used by various preprocessors (transpilers) to transform these tokens into standard ECMAScript.
