## Functional Programming

## Reactive Programming

## Stream

**Streams**, functional sequences of events over time.

**Everything** is a stream.

> **STREAMS** Traditionally, the term *stream* was used in programming languages as an abstract object related to I/O operations such as reading a file, reading a socket, or requesting data from an HTTP server. For instance, Node.js implements readable, writable, and duplex streams for doing just this. In the RP world, we expand the definition of a stream to mean *any* data source that can be consumed.
