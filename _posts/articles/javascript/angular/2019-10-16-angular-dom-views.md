* TOC

* `ElementRef`: 
* ``:
* `ngTemplateOutlet`: marks a DOM element as a ViewContainer and inserts an embedded view created by a template in it without the need to explicitly doing this in component class.
* `ngComponentOutlet`: is analogues to `ngTemplateOutlet` with the difference that it creates a **host view** (instantiates a component), not an embedded view.
