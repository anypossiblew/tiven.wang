## Backgrounds

### Apache Camel
[Apache Camel][Apache-Camel] ™ is a versatile open-source integration framework based on known [Enterprise Integration Patterns][Enterprise-Integration-Patterns].

### Enterprise Integration Patterns
[Camel][Apache-Camel] supports most of the [Enterprise Integration Patterns][Enterprise-Integration-Patterns] from the excellent book by [Gregor Hohpe and Bobby Woolf][amazon-Enterprise-Integration-Patterns].

### Download HCI-DS Agent

[Data Services Agent][1]

## Camel’s Message Model

### Message
![Image Camel Message](/images/cloud/hcp/hci/camel-message.jpg)
{: .pull-right}

Fundamental entity **containing the data** being carried and routed in Camel

* Messages have a body (a payload), headers, and optional attachments
* Messages are uniquely identified with an identifier of type `java.lang.String`
* Headers
  * Headers are values associated with the message Sender identifier, hints about content encoding, authentication information,…
  * Headers are name-value-pairs Name is a unique, case-insensitive string Value is of type `java.lang.Object`
* Attachments
  * Optional – typically used for Web service and e-mail components
* Body
  * Type: `java.lang.Object` -> any kind of content is allowed

### Exchange
![Image Camel Message](/images/cloud/hcp/hci/camel-exchange.jpg)
{: .pull-right}

The **message’s container** during routing

* Provides support for various interaction types between systems, known as Message Exchange Patterns (MEP)
  * InOnly: a one-way message (e.g. JMS messaging)
  * InOut: a request-response message (e.g. HTTP-based transports)
* Exchange ID: a unique ID that identifies the exchange
* MEP
  * InOnly: exchange contains an “in message” only
  * InOut: exchange contains an “in message” and an “out message” containing the reply message for the caller
* Exception: If an error occurs during runtime, the Exception field will be filled
* Properties: Similar to message headers, but they last for the duration of the entire exchange; they contain global-level information; you can store and retrieve properties at any point during the lifetime of an exchange

### Goals
Store data in the message header and in the properties of the exchange. Retrieve data from header and properties to build the reply message
