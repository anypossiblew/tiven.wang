> For a long time, the blogging platform options have been Blogger and WordPress. Each has had its pros and cons, but as technology has developed around the blogging world, new options have emerged. One size doesn’t fit all needs on blogging platforms and new, nuanced options have been a long time coming! Today we are coming [Tumblr][Tumblr] versus [Medium][Medium]. Both are exciting blogging venues for different reasons. As you read the comparisons, consider what format and platform will best serve your needs!

## Tumblr

[Tumblr][Tumblr]’s microblogging platform has almost 300 million blogs with over 134 billion blog posts! The short, multimedia post-heavy formatting of Tumblr lends itself to the quick and easy post and getting your name out to a large group of people quickly. The uniqueness of Tumblr is the meshing of the microblogging platform with the social media networking allowing for a high scheduling capacity with strong engagement.

Tumblr’s intuitive and easy posting has helped it make it one of the most popular blogging platforms, you can even post from your email or any device, quickly and easily. It also makes it easy to find people with similar interests and focus. When blogging, your first 20 tags will show in a search, providing a wide net for growing an audience. Tumblr’s feature, Ask Me Anything, has been a great addition to the Tumblr options, giving you the chance to ask or be asked questions from the audience, increasing engagement with you and what you are promoting! Anyone can find you because the search options are wide on Tumblr. You can search with text, names, and tags, widening the potential audience growth.

Tumblr also allows you to create themed, secondary blogs for different campaigns, changing the look and feel of each campaign you are working on. Tumblr provides a large array of free or premium themes, giving you the chance to create a unique format to reach a wide audience. You can easily measure your success by the number of reblogs and likes your posts receive. If you want more in-depth analysis, use Google Analytics to assess your page.
Tumblr is an amazing platform with flexibility and depth. However, it does have its own set of drawbacks. Contributors are allowed only one primary blog with one contributor. You can set up secondary blogs with a variety of contributors to accomplish this goal, but if you are looking for a format to have only one blog, this might not be the right platform for you.

Tumblr is also considered to not work as well with SEO and doesn’t really allow for long blog posts. It works best for the highly visual, multimedia-heavy, short posts. Consider your goals and desires before choosing Tumblr’s unique platform.

Tumblr’s support network provides a comprehensive list of possible issues with a ways to troubleshoot yourself. If you can’t find an answer, you have to fill out a contact form to receive a response to your issue. It doesn’t provide phone or chat support.

## Medium

[Medium][Medium]’s format is night and day to Tumblr’s format. Medium started in 2012, making it one of the youngest blogging platforms around. It focuses on a clean, minimalist look that is not customizable. There is one standard style.

Medium is a unique blend of part publisher and part social network and self-describes as “the perfect place to read and write.” The creative team at Medium and a variety of freelancers (Medium users) collaborate to create articles and feeds centered around high quality articles. It also provides the opportunity to edit and share feedback before publishing with select individuals you have granted editorial access to.

Medium’s audience is highly professional and well-educated with a whopping 95% of their readership being college graduates with 43% making six-figure incomes. We’re awesome, aren’t we?

The readers are largely young with 70% falling under the age of 50. Tech and business professionals flock to Medium’s unique platform.

Medium’s support options are more diverse than most with Twitter, email, contact form, and submit request formatting all available. It doesn’t provide phone or chat support.
Medium’s star is a slow rise because its focus is much narrower meaning your audience is smaller. Medium’s internal numbers show a 25 million user interaction, which is significantly lower than most blogging or social network platforms. It is a platform with a much more specific audience which needs to be weighed as you choose a platform, and if it will advance your goals.

Tumblr and Medium are night and day differences of social media and blogging platforms. Each cater to goals more focused on different objectives. Write out your personal objectives and the audience you hope to reach before connecting to a format.
