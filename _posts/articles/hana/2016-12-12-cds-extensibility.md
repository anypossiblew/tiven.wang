title: From a CDS View to an OData Service
excerpt: "HANA content can be modeled in the HANA database based on the replicated and local data. Basically, HANA content will consumed in the ABAP layer through transient InfoProviders on Operational Data Providers (ODPs). Based on the transient providers, BEx Queries are defined. These Queries serve as a central consumption entity. They are exposed via EasyQuery to allow access via OData for HTML5 UIs and native mobile applications or external access from reports via the BusinessObjects BI Platform."
