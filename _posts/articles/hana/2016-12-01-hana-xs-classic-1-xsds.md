title: HANA XS Classic part 1 - XS Data Services
excerpt: "XS Data Services (XSDS) are a JavaScript library for the XS engine to consume SAP HANA artifacts that have been defined using Core Data Services (CDS), the central data modeling concept of HANA.  The XSDS library supports the import of CDS entities and their associations and offers managed and unmanaged manipulation of such instances. With additional features such as transaction handling, lazy navigation, support for custom types and views, and incremental query building XSDS offers a level of convenience that makes writing native HANA applications with XS a breeze."
