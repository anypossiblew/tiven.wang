title: CDS based Virtual Data Model (VDM)
excerpt: "The concept of the Virtual Data Model (VDM) has been introduced with HANA Live two years ago. Meanwhile CDS (Core Data Services) offers the ability to define database views independent of the application platform. ABAP CDS views are currently managed via ABAP. In future they will also support native-HANA access. As such CDS models contribute to the massive simplification of the suite stack towards the envisioned two-tier architecture.
VDM views defined with the ABAP CDS technology are not restricted to read-only analytical use-cases, but will be used e.g. within search and transactional applications, too.
Most of the key modeling principles for CDS views outlined below are taken from the already existing guidelines for the VDM based on HANA calculation views."

## VDM
The Virtual Data Model (VDM) represents the simplified and harmonized business oriented semantically enriched data model of the suite.
“Virtual” refers to the fact that the VDM semantical model may deviate from the historically grown persistent model of database tables to make it simpler and easier to understand.

The VDM exposes the Business Data of an SAP system as an **_Understandable_**, **_Comprehensive_** and **_Executable_**
model for consumers in **_Transactional Applications_**, **_Analytics_**, **_External Interfaces_**
fulfilling important product qualities, e.g. **_Performance_**, **_Extensibility_**, **_Security and Privacy_**, **_Consistency_**
as a reusable, stable and compatible platform for **_SAP internal Development_**, **_Partners_**, **_Customers_**

thus increasing development efficiency and fostering ease of consumption.

### Implementation
There are currently two different implementation approaches:

* In S/4HANA the VDM is established by specifically classified/annotated ABAP CDS Views.
* in HanaLive the VDM is implemented by calculation views.

### View Layering of the CDS based VDM

### VDM CDS Meta Model Overview  
The following diagram is a reference of the VDM Meta Model showing the most important specializations of views, fields, associations and parameters, which form the VDM meta model, in effect. It also shows the annotations that are used to define these specializations.

### Metadata Consumption by Frameworks
In the context of the consumption frameworks the main goals of the CDS based meta models are

* Enabling the reuse of metadata definitions across various realizations of a given domain like Fioiri UI and analytics,
* Provisioning of a common unified and harmonized meta model for all frameworks
