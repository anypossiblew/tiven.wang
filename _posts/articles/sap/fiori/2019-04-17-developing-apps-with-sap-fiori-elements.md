> App developers can use SAP Fiori elements to create SAP Fiori applications based on **OData services** and **annotations** that _**don't need JavaScript UI coding**_ . The resulting app uses predefined views and controllers that are provided centrally. This means no application-specific view instances are required. The SAPUI5 runtime interprets metadata and annotations of the underlying OData service and uses the corresponding views for the SAP Fiori app at startup.
