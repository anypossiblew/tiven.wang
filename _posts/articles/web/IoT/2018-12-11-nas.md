### file-based protocols

NAS uses file-based protocols such as NFS (popular on UNIX systems), SMB (Server Message Block) (used with MS Windows systems), AFP (used with Apple Macintosh computers), or NCP (used with OES and Novell NetWare). 

### SAN
SAN (storage area network)

### Clustered NAS

## Don't build a NAS with your Pi
First off, why create a Raspberry Pi NAS? I expect there will be some people who could go into great depth about how the Pi is not a suitable platform for a network-attached storage device. Here's a few weak points:

* poor I/O - no SATA, limited USB bandwidth
* slow networking
* lack of ECC RAM
* not suitable for ZFS
* unreliable SD card for booting
