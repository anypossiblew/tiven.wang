    excerpt: "JavaScript, often abbreviated as 'JS', is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, interpreted run-time language. It has been standardized in the ECMAScript language specification. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production; the majority of websites employ it, and all modern Web browsers support it without the need for plug-ins. JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language, since it supports prototype-based with first-class functions, imperative, and functional programming paradigms."

  - title: JavaScript - Create Server by Node.js (JavaScript version)
    url: /articles/training-javascript-2-server-javascript/
    excerpt: "Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment for executing JavaScript code server-side. Historically, JavaScript was used primarily for client-side scripting, in which scripts written in JavaScript are embedded in a webpage's HTML, to be run client-side by a JavaScript engine in the user's web browser. Node.js enables JavaScript to be used for server-side scripting, and runs scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser."
